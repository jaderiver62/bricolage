## Description

`Bricolage:
*noun*
* a construction or creation from a diverse range of available things.`



This projects utilizes a MongoDB NoSQL database to build the back-end of an API.

This RESTful API is ideal for building a social networking application.  It performs CRUD operations on the database to enable Users to post Thoughts, post Reactions to Thoughts and to build a list of Friends for each User.

When a User is deleted, Bricolage also deletes all of the associated thougts created by the User.  Thoughts and Reactions can also be deleted.  See our [demo video](#usage) for more details.
